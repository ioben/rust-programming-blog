Information regarding Official Documentation and install instructions are available online.

<!--more-->

The Official Rust programming language website is located at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Official Documentation for rust is available at: [rust-lang.org/documentation](https://rust-lang.org/en-US/documentation.html).

Here, you can find several helpful resources for learning Rust, for example, the Rust Programming language book, as well as Rust By Example, a website that provides an interactive rust tutorial.

Rust has a very active developer community, and can encourage those with questions to ask on one of their many IRC Channels. Rust also has a Youtube channel where members of the Rust community as well as developers post video presentations related to the language.

### Installation

#### Windows

Download the .msi installer from: [rust-lang.org/downloads.html](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/downloads.html)


#### Linux and Mac

In your shell, run

```
$ curl -sSf https://static.rust-lang.org/rustup.sh | sh
```

Or download the tarball/.pkg files directly from the link above.


## Compiling and Running

Rust files are denoted by their .rs file extension. They can be compiled into binaries using Rust's compiler, rustc as follows:

```
$ rustc program.rs
```

A binary will be created and can be run as a normal executable in the shell:

```
$ ./hello
```

## Package Manager

Cargo's Official website can be found at [crates.io](https://crates.io/).

According to Cargo's website, it "allows Rust projects to declare their various dependencies and ensure that youâ€™ll always get a repeatable build."

To start a binary program called "program" with cargo, use the command

```
$ cargo new program --bin
```

You can create libraries rather than binary programs by leaving off the `--bin` flag.

Cargo keeps track of changes, and is similar to GNUs make utility. To build your project, in the projects directory, run

```
$ cargo build
 ```

Then you can run the binary just like you would had you manually used `rustc` to compile every file.

## Unit Testing in Rust with Cargo

Cargo can run unit or integration tests for your Rust build with the command

```
$ cargo test
```

A test function is marked by the header `#[test]` Cargo's test output will be in the format:

```
$ test [test name] ... [ok | FAILED]
```

In most cases, a passing test is one in which the test does `panic!`. A test will only `panic!` if an assertion is not met. The assertion macro is denoted by the `assert!` keyword.

```
#[test]
fn will_fail(){
  assert!(1==2);
}
 ```

This test will fail. If your acceptance test requires that your assertion will fail, then you use the `#[should_panic]` header.

```
#[test]
#[should_panic]
fn will_pass(){
  assert!(1==2);
}
```
